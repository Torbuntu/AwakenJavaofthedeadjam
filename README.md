## Day 1

Day one was just figuring out what to make and playing around with Aseprite to see what I could do quickly.
Created a Hero character and got him working inside the Java code in FemtoIDE. Initial game design plans have been drawn up as follows (pretty rough sketch):
```
[[ Awaken ]] <- working title

5 stages. 
Each stage in a different location with unique undead foes and a mega boss.

Player travels to one of the areas to research the culture and awakens the
undead inadvertantly. The character must then defeat all the undead and also
the megaboss to discover the treasures of the region.

Weapons: Yo-yo, Shovel 


1. North America : Skeletons and the Skinwalker 

2. China : Terracotta Army and Qin Shi Huang :

3. Romania : Vampyres and Dracula :

4. Scandinavia : Draugr and Ivar the Boneless :

5. Egypt : Mummies and Anubis : 
```
This is obviously just an initial run at setting up the game and planning a rough "sketch" of what it can be. The idea is that it is a treasure hunting game gone wrong. Your hero travels to a distant location to hunt for mystical coffee beans, but instead ends up waking the dead! Fighting off hordes of undead monsters until a megaboss arrives. When the megaboss is destroyed the Hero then collects the mystical coffee beans and enjoys the joe of the land. (WIP)

Created a Git repo with the WIP title Awaken. Pushed the project sources to it so I can now work from any computer.
Downloaded and set up the [FemtoIDE Game Jam Edition](https://github.com/felipemanga/FemtoIDE/releases/tag/v0.0.15b)

Playing with a state machine using a switch case and int variiable.

Started using `CGArne` as the default color palette. Might change in the future. Set the assets to indexed mode in Aseprite so switching palette might be easier.

List of palettes from [here (16 color)](https://lospec.com/palette-list)

Finished the shovel attack animation.

Tried to fix the walking animation.
